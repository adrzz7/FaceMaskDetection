# Face Mask Detection Using ResNet50 & GoogleNet

A group project that applies transfer learning to classify face images as "mask" or "no mask." Pretrained models (ResNet50 and InceptionV3) were used to build and compare performance on a dataset of face mask images.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- OpenCV (for image handling)
- scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)

## 📌 Key Features
- Utilized ResNet50 and InceptionV3 via transfer learning
- Image augmentation and preprocessing using `ImageDataGenerator`
- Evaluated model accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Compared performance across both pretrained architectures

## 👥 Project Role
Group of 3 — my focus was on implementing and fine-tuning transfer learning models.

## 📁 Files
- `FaceMaskDetection.ipynb`: Training, evaluation, and visualization of results
- `dataset/`: Contains preprocessed image sets (optional for uploading)
- `results/`: Confusion matrices and performance metrics

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Transfer learning
- Image classification
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Team-based project collaboration
